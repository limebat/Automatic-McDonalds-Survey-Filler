# McDonaldsSurveyFiller
Fill out your McDonald survey -- Selenium and Google OCR project.

What makes this script special:
Uses Google OCR technology to automatically detect and store McDonalds survey codes to file. It takes these codes and sends them to your laptop, where you can then automatically fill out any receipt. It doesn't even have to be your receipt!

High level overview:
You can go to Google Lens -- scan your receipt -- copy the survey code -- send to your laptop via Google account. The python script will then execute once copied to your Google account on your computer. It will fill out the survey, where at the end it will print the verification code.
